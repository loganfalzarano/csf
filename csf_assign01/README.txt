Names: Logan Falzarano, Tal Magdish

We wrote all of the functionality for MS1 together. Work was shared evenly.

The same applies for MS2, we wrote functions on our own, with Tal focusing on testing, arithmetic, comparison, etc.
and Logan focusing on hex formatting, creating, etc. We had trouble with add so we worked on it collaboratively,
each of us going through multiple versions before Logan reached a final product.
